Nerves project experiment. Aims:

1. Get new project on Raspberry PI, from scratch with Nerves
2. Control GPIO from simple web app
3. Trigger the M&Ms saxophonist by toggling a GPIO port on an off
4. Integrate with Slack, so the Saxophonist and be triggered from there.

## Notes

### Get on the PI.

1. Get a plug router into the supervision tree, so we know it's all working.
